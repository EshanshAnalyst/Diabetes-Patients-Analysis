# Diabetes-Patients-Analysis

## Project Description: 
This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset related to diabetes. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the occurrence of diabetes based on various health metrics. Throughout the process, various data preprocessing techniques are applied, including handling missing values and data visualization. The logistic regression model is employed as the primary machine learning technique for making predictions.
